                    You expressly acknowledge that you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws by yourself, your agents, and any linked staff accounts, as well as any Patient Accounts connected to your dispensary. BOVA does not provide legal or compliance advice concerning applicable laws. The inclusion of references to specific laws or regulations is not an indication that those laws are applicable to you, nor does it imply that other laws are not. BOVA takes no position on the legality or appropriateness of recommending or reselling Products to Patients. It is your responsibility to consult with qualified advisors to ensure compliance with all applicable laws.
                </p>
                <h4 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Accounts and Passwords</h4>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'>Certain features or services offered on or through the Platform require you to register for an Account (including creating a username and password). You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account information, including your password, and for all activities that occur under your Account. BOVA will accept the instructions of anyone who claims to be authorized to make changes to your Account if they provide your username and password online, by email, by phone, or through any third-party service you may use to access the Platform. You agree to notify BOVA immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account or password. You may not use the Account, username, or password of another person or entity at any time without the express permission of the Account holder. BOVA is not responsible for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section, including the misuse or misappropriation of your information. You agree to indemnify BOVA against any claims, damages, losses, or costs resulting from a breach of your obligations concerning your Account and Account information.</p>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'> <span className='font-semibold text-black'>Practitioner Seller Accounts:</span> Practitioners who wish to sell Products through the Platform and access the full suite of services available for their dispensary must register for Practitioner Seller Accounts. BOVA requires Practitioners to provide specific identification and contact information to register for these accounts. </p>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'>By creating an Account, you consent to receive electronic communications from us (e.g., emails, SMS, or push notifications where applicable). These communications may include notices about your Account (e.g., account changes, password resets, and other transactional information) and are part of your relationship with us. Additionally, we may send promotional communications such as newsletters, special offers, surveys, or other information we believe may interest you. You can adjust your communication preferences by following the instructions in our promotional messages or modifying your settings in your Account. Please allow up to 10 business days for changes to take effect. Note that opting out of marketing communications does not exempt you from receiving transactional messages related to your use of the Platform or communications required as part of an existing business relationship.</p>

                <h4 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Payments and Sales Tax</h4>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'>BOVA sells its services and Products to you at a percentage of the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). You may sell Products through the Platform within the allowable range of your MSRP discount. BOVA collects its fee when you complete a sale to a Patient. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and professional ethical guidelines regarding the sale of Products, including disclosure obligations and pricing practices. Applicable sales taxes, shipping fees, and Payment Processor fees will be added to your Product sales. Payments and distributions are handled by the Payment Processor, and proceeds from your sales are deposited into your designated bank account based on the cadence you set. You are the vendor, retailer, and seller of record for all Product sales through your dispensary and are solely responsible for managing all transactions with Patients.</p>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'>
                    BOVA is responsible for collecting and remitting retail sales taxes for Products sold through the Platform. You agree to provide BOVA with any required documentation, such as reseller statements, upon request, to ensure compliance with applicable sales tax laws. You remain responsible for compliance with any marketplace seller reporting laws and for remitting any non-sales taxes, including but not limited to business and occupation taxes, income taxes, or similar obligations.
                </p>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'>
                    Practitioners are fully responsible for Products sold to their Patients. BOVA reserves the right to adjust its fees at any time.
                </p>
                <h4 className='text-lg font-semibold'>Order Processing</h4>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'>
                    The Products available through your dispensary to Patient Accounts are considered invitations to make offers to purchase Products and are not direct offers to sell. A properly completed and submitted order request by a Patient Account constitutes an offer to purchase the referenced Products. An order is deemed accepted only when the Patient Account receives a confirmation, either on the Platform or via the email address associated with the Patient Account, indicating that the order and payment have been processed. BOVA reserves the right to refuse all or part of any order request through your dispensary, limit the quantities of Products available for sale, or reject, correct, cancel, or terminate any order request at any time and for any reason.
                </p>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'>
                    The prices for Products available through your dispensary to Patient Accounts are displayed on the Platform (including MSRP), along with all applicable charges and taxes, which are shown when a Patient Account makes a purchase. Unless otherwise specified, all invoiced amounts are due immediately upon purchase confirmation and will be processed using the credit card information associated with the Patient Account placing the order.
                </p>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'>
                    Unless otherwise stated, all fees are listed in United States Dollars for Accounts in the United States and in Canadian Dollars for Accounts in Canada. Receipts for purchased Products will be provided to the Patient or Practitioner, as applicable, through the Platform or sent to the email address associated with the respective Account.
                </p>
                <p className='text-[15px] my-3 text-gray-500'>
                    Patient Accounts are responsible for all shipping costs. Title and risk of loss transfer to the Practitioner upon delivery to the shipping carrier, before being passed on to the ordering Patient Account. Any shipping times displayed on the Platform are estimates and are subject to variation. Additional policies regarding shipping and returns are available on the Platform. Returns are processed on your behalf by BOVA, and the corresponding commissions will be deducted from your account.
                </p>
